# Socket Server-Client Messaging App

A simple Python-based messaging application using sockets for communication between a server and multiple clients. This project demonstrates basic network programming concepts and can be extended for cybersecurity applications.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Supports real-time communication between server and clients.
- ✅ Uses TCP sockets for reliable data transmission.
- ✅ Allows both sending and receiving messages between server and client.
- ✅ Basic error handling and graceful exit on "exit" command.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 3️⃣ Run the Server
python socket.server.py
💡 The server will listen on port 9999 and wait for client connections.

### 3️⃣ Run the Client
Open another terminal and run the client:
python socket.client.py
💡 The client will connect to the server and allow two-way communication.

### 📜 Usage Instructions
1- 1️⃣ The server starts and waits for connections.
2- 2️⃣ A client connects and sends a message.
3- 3️⃣ The server receives and echoes the message back.
4- 4️⃣ Both sides can send messages continuously.
5- 5️⃣ Type "exit" to close the connection.

### 💻 Example Output
#### 🔹 Server Terminal
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Server is listening on port 9999...
Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 54321)
Client sent: Hello, Server!
Enter message: Hi, Client!
#### 🔹 Client Terminal
Connected to the server 127.0.0.1
Enter message: Hello, Server!
Server replied: Hi, Client!

##🔐 Security Considerations (Cybersecurity Relevance)
- ⚠ Avoid sending sensitive data in plaintext (use encryption like TLS).
- ⚠ Prevent buffer overflow attacks by limiting input size.
- ⚠ Sanitize input to prevent command injection (if implementing a reverse shell).
